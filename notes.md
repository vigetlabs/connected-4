Ideas:

1. Measure the time it takes to drop from "normal" to X% and back up to "normal".
  - might be different X% and times for different light levels
  - probably better with more light?
  - determine a good minimum perhaps?

2. Compare dips with others
  - define a score perhaps?
    - % drop
    - time
  - if similar looking over some time period then they invalidate each other

To study:
- biggest % drop from and recovery
- red vs. yellow
- min/max time period
  - different for different light levels?

- Calculate velocity
- for each point (if you're ascending)
  - look back in history until the last time it was that point
  - measure min and max velocity in the time frame
  - save the time frame
